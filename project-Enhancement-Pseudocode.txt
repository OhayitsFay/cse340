** # Project Enhancement Implementation**
1. Database Integration
A new table named review was created with the following fields:
i. review_id (unique identifier for each review)
ii. rating (numeric value representing user rating)
iii. review_text (content of the userâ€™s review)
iv. timestamp (records when the review was posted)
v. vehicle_id (links the review to a specific vehicle)
vi. reviewer_id (identifies the user who posted the review)
An asynchronous function was added to the inventory-model file to retrieve and manage data from this table.

2. Updated Model Functionalities
A new SQL query was implemented in the inventoryModel file to interact with the review table.

3. Updated Controller Functionalities
The inventoryController file now includes functions for retrieving and submitting reviews.
Additional POST and GET routes were integrated into the inventoryRoute file for handling review-related requests.

4. New User Interface Elements
A review link was appended to the templates function within the Utilities root file.
A dedicated EJS file was introduced in the inventory directory to render reviews for users.

5. Input Validation
Client-side validation was enforced in the EJS review file using the required attribute to prevent empty submissions.
Server-side validation was introduced to ensure data integrity, providing error messages when necessary. The checkReviewData function, added to the inventory-validation file, handles this.

6. Error Handling
Middleware for handling errors was implemented to improve system stability and provide meaningful feedback to users.
